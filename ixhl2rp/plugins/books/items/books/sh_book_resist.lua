<p>Resist!</p>

<p>People of Earth, don't be fooled by the Combine's lies! They seek to put you to sleep with golden promises: by when you wake, all that we had will be gone- stolen!</p>

<p>Do not listen to them! Stand up and fight to be free, cast off the shackles of the combine and embrace your humanity!</p>

<p>And for those of you who inform on your brothers or serve the enemy, remember this quote!<br>
"First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out—<br>
Because I was not a Socialist.<br>
<br>
Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out— <br>
Because I was not a Trade Unionist.<br>
<br>
Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out— <br>
Because I was not a Jew.<br>
<br>
Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me."</p>

<p>Make no mistake, the Combine are coming for you too. Stand now, while there is still someone left to stand with you. <br>
Do what you can to disrupt their rule. Heroes come in all shapes, you don't need a gun. Help your fellow citizens, frustrate the Combine's efforts. If you can cover up anti-combine activity or trick an officer into wasting his time, do it!</p>
