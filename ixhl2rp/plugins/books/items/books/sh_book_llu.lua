The date of February 25th, 2020 proved a historic milestone for the 22nd VLC Sector 19 Infantry Company, as these powerful men and women
who would give their lives to our Benefactors have shown major success against the insurgent group known as the 'Bedouin Freedom Fighters'.
These Proselytes, heroic Loyalists who have voluntarily offered their service to the Union, have shown loyalty through their service and
have gone above and beyond the call of duty.

During my visit to Sector 19, in the beautiful City 51, I have been given the honor of interviewing one of the most significant members amongst
the Proselytes. During his duties in maintaining civil stability he has received numerous awards and widespread recognition for his acts. The
conscript, none other than Second Lieutenant Axel Errigan, gave a brief summary of the daily tasks and duties of an officer inside the 22nd.
He revealed that his hard work to our Benefactors has more than paid off, its generous perks letting him spend more time relaxing as a White-tier
loyalist, giving him ample opportunity to relax with the troops he has the privilege of being brothers-in-arms with.

Before Axel was transferred to the 2nd VLC Sector 19 Civil-Enforcement Company, he had experienced a brush with these self-proclaimed 'Revolutionaries',
in actuality little more than insurgents and terrorists. To his better judgement, he decided to omit the gruesome details left by these horrible
malignants, claiming that they must be stopped and be brought to justice by our Benefactors. I, for one, whole-heartedly agree.

You, the loyal citizens under the ever-vigilant eyes of Our Benefactors, are kept safe due to their sacrifice, alongside the diligent protection of
the brave Civil Protection force that keeps order in our wonderful cities. These proselytes are doing their part, and I urge all true loyal citizens
to do theirs as well. Sign up for voluntary conscription today and receive the benefits that accompany such an eventful and positive experience, and
rest easy at night knowing you are helping keep the innocent folks back home safe and sound.
