<p>Once upon a time, there was a little girl who lived in a village near the forest.
<br>Whenever, she went out, the little girl wore a red riding cloak, so everyone in the village called her Little Red Riding Hood.</p>

<p>One morning, Little Red Riding Hood asked her mother if she could go to visit her grandmother.
<br>"That's a good idea!", her mother said. So they packed a nice basket for Little Red Riding Hood to take to her grandmother.</p>

<p>The grandmother lived out in the woods, a half hour from the village. When Little Red entered the woods a wolf came up to her.
<br>She did not know what a wicked animal he was, and was not afraid of him.
<br>
"Good day to you, Little Red.", he said. "Thank you, wolf!", she replied. "Where are you going so early, Little Red?"
<br>"To grandmothers.", she replied. "And what are you carrying under your apron?" He asked.
<br>"Grandmother is sick and weak, and I am taking her some cake and wine. We baked yesterday, and they should give her strength."</p>

<p>The wolf thought to himself, "now there is a tasty bite for me. I'll go eat the grandmother, haha."
<br>"Little Red, just where does your grandmother live?", he asked.
<br>
She told him that her house is a good half hour from here in the woods.
<br>"A half hour? Screw that." he said, and then he ate the bitch. The end.</p>

<p>The moral of the story is to never approach talking wolves.</p>
