<p><strong>Day 34:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva;">I've been walking this road for days. I don't even remember where I am anymore, just the direction of which I am going. West.</span></p>
<p>I was dropped just outside this place by those two fucking idiots who thought giving me a pistol, a vest and some food salvaging tools. Lucky for me a scout is always prepared, so I'm not too hungry atleast. If my mum was here she'd cook me up a really good meal, pork chops maybe, the thing she cooked the last time I saw her.</p>
<p>I really miss her. So much. Fuck! Why did this happen? Where did they come from! Fucking Blair! If he didn't completely strip us of our nuclear capabilities, we might've been able to bind with America and wipe those combine fuckers out! I only voted once, ever, and I didn't vote for him, stupid fucking idiots. I guess nobody could really see what was going to happen but, seriously? Jesus.</p>
<p>I think the biggest regret of this all is I never managed to see my sister's play, she was training so hard for it all and this shit happens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Day 35:</strong></p>
<p>I ran into a few zombies today, they seemed to be moving like a horde down the road. I ignored them, as usual, but the smell was horrible.</p>
<p>Looking around, I think I'm in Poland... it looks like Polish writing... as soon as I get down to France, I'll go through the Channel Tunnel and walk straight up to England. Why would the combine touch a remote farm town like Boston?</p>
<p><strong>Day 36:</strong></p>
<p>Fuck all happend today, I almost fell down a cliff maybe but that was just nothing. Food is getting scarce however.</p>
<p><strong>Day 37:</strong></p>
<p>&lt;The next part is stained a little in a strange yellow blood making it quite unreadable, but you can make out the word "Crab".&gt;<br /></p>
